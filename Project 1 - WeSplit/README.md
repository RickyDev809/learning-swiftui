# Project 1 â€“ WeSplit

## Overview
WeSplit is a simple SwiftUI app that helps users split a bill among friends and calculate tips easily. It focuses on core SwiftUI concepts like managing state, forms, and user input.

> **Challenge Extension:** Alongside this project, I completed a unit converter challenge to convert between temperature, length, and other units. This was a separate exercise to build my understanding of Swift and data handling.

## Features
- Enter total bill amount  
- Choose number of people to split with  
- Select tip percentage  
- Real-time calculation of amount per person  
- Clean and user-friendly interface  

## What I Learned
- Managing state with `@State` properties  
- Building forms with SwiftUI's `Form` and `Picker`  
- Formatting currency values  
- Creating reactive UI that updates instantly with user input  
- Practiced unit conversions and data transformations in a separate challenge
