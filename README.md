# Learning SwiftUI - Projects 

This repository contains my progress through the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) challenge by Paul Hudson.

Each folder includes a standalone Xcode project that I built to practice SwiftUI fundamentals, animations, layouts, state management, and more.

## Projects So Far

- **Day 1 â€“ WeSplit:** A simple app to split bills and calculate tips using `@State` and `Form`.
- **Day 2 â€“ Guess the Flag:** A fun game testing knowledge of country flags using buttons, images, and animations.
- **Day 3 â€“ Views and Modifiers:** Practicing custom view modifiers and reusable views to build cleaner UI components.

More projects coming soon as I work through the challenge!
